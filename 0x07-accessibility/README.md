Accessibility

WCAG is organized around four principles often called by the acronym POUR:

Perceivable: Can users perceive the content? This helps us keep in mind that just because something is perceivable with one sense, such as sight, that doesn’t mean that all users can perceive it.

Operable: Can users use UI components and navigate the content? For example, something that requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can’t use a mouse or touch screen.

Understandable: Can users understand the content? Can users understand the interface and is it consistent enough to avoid confusion?

Robust: Can the content be consumed by a wide variety of user agents (browsers)? Does it work with assistive technology?
